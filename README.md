# Android Base App
This is the base of an Android Project with some core libs and architecture stuff already built-in.
## This is an Android Base App using:
* [Clean Architecture](https://medium.com/@dmilicic/a-detailed-guide-on-developing-android-apps-using-the-clean-architecture-pattern-d38d71e94029)
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html)
* [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger)
* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)
* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)/[RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)

## What should I do after cloning this project?
1. Change your [remote-url](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/)
2. Change package names, applicationId, and the desired min and target SDK versions (default is 16 and 28, respectively) to suit your application better;
3. Update all libraries and make sure that your Kotlin, Gradle and Build Tools versions are all up to date;
4. The MainActivity/MainPresenter has an example on how to use all the layers of the application. This is just a sample, so adjust it as you like.
